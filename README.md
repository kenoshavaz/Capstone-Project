# Capstone-Project
The final project to be worked on this fall semester

TO PERFORM WIRELESS BRIDGING USING TWO OR MORE ESP8266 MODULES TO TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE DATA BETWEEN ISOLATED NETWORKS.

OUR PROJECT WILL INVOLVE TESTING THE FEASIBILITY OF USING MULTIPLE ESP8266 WIRELESS MODULES. THIS COULD ALSO EXTEND THE RANGE OF A LOCAL AREA NETWORK BY DISTANCES ON THE ORDER OF âˆ¼1KM.
